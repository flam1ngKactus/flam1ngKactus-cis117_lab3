Group Lab 3
Due Thursday by 11:59pm Points 18 Submitting a website url or a file upload File Types zip Available until Nov 13 at 11:59pm
Objectives: 
Work with input/output files in Python as well as handle possible exceptions. 

Team Work:
Team work is important in the real world of software development. In this lab you will have an opportunity to work with a partner, although this will be optional. Students will select their partner by going to People in the navigation menu. Please add yourself to the first group available. If you choose to work by yourself, you are still responsible for submitting the entire program.

Only those working in a team will have to fill out the Lab 3 Peer Evaluation assignment and that will qualify them for an extra-credit point. The eligibility for extra-credit will be determined by your partner's confirmation on your contribution to the lab. Only one partner need to submit.

You may choose to complete this assignment as a Python script (.py file) or as a Notebook (.ipynb file).

Your assignment:
Watch the following video where they explain how to read/write to files using "with": Python Tutorial: Reading and Writing to FilesLinks to an external site.
Watch the following video where they explain exception handling: Python Tutorial: Using Try Except Blocks for Exception HandlingLinks to an external site.
Meet with your partners to discuss the approach to this problem. Don't leave it to the last minute!
Write a Python script that reads the following CSV file containing information on countries (country_full.csv Download country_full.csv) and splits the countries by region generating one file per region. For example: Europe.CSV should have only European countries.
Keep the country names and region in the output files.
The CSV file format is explained in the textbook section 14.3
Incorporate exception handling (try/except) as there are many errors that may occur when trying to access files, such as IOError, FileNotFoundError, PermissionError
 Documentation:
Write a header comment at the beginning of the module with the following information:
# CIS-117 Lab4
# Write a description of your module here
# Your first and last name here
If you worked with a partner, Group# and the names of the person who collaborated with you
Write here a brief description about how the collaboration worked (who worked on which part)
Suggested division of workload if working with a partner:
One partner works on the reading part while the other focuses on the writing part.
Those working individually are still required to complete the entire program.
Working individually is a choice, not an excuse!
Testing:
You are supposed to test your script to see if it is working. You will submit the source code and the output files generated.

Submission:
Here are three options to submit your work:

Option 1 - GitHub:
Upload your project, the input file and all output files to the Git repository containing your project
Submit a link to the Git repository
